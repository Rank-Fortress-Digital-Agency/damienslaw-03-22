          <p>
            Many people are faced with an ugly surprise at tax time—a tax bill
            that is hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than expected.
            For most workers, their employers are required to withhold the
            correct amount of taxes each pay period, and self-employed workers
            typically pay estimated taxes every quarter directly to the
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a>.
            There should never be surprises when filing a tax return. However,
            many taxpayers that owe taxes find themselves asking, “What if you
            cannot pay your taxes?” Options are available for people who owe
            taxes to the IRS and do not have the means to pay it. A qualified
            tax attorney at Damiens Law can help. Consider calling (662)
            442-4423 in Mississippi or (901) 499-4466 in Tennessee to schedule a
            consultation to get answers to some of your tax questions.

          <h2>File a Tax Return, Even If You Cannot Pay</h2>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/what-if-i-cant-pay-my-taxes"
              >IRS</a
            >
            requires that all tax returns are filed by the typical deadline of
            April 15. Some people make the mistake of believing that they do not
            have to file a tax return until they are able to pay the tax bill.
            However, the IRS considers not filing a tax return to avoid paying
            taxes to be tax evasion, which is a crime. At minimum, the agency
            will assess a late filing fee, which can be up to ten times more
            than the fee for not paying taxes due on time. If a person is found
            guilty of tax evasion, however, he or she can face up to five years
            in jail.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that the deadline to pay taxes is not the
            date that the return is filed. Tax payments are not due until the
            filing deadline of April 15. Therefore, filers who submit their tax
            returns in February or March still have a few weeks to pay the IRS.
            Some individuals may file for a tax extension that will give them
            until the middle of July to file their tax returns. However, an
            extension for filing does not delay the date that the payment is
            due, and an estimated tax must be paid by that April deadline to
            avoid penalties.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Make a Partial Payment by the Deadline</h2>
          <p>
            Unpaid taxes accrue interest, so tax filers who owe the IRS will end
            up paying more than the initial tax bill after interest is added on.
            Tax filers who wonder what if you cannot pay your taxes must
            remember that not paying taxes that are owed under the law is not an
            option. The government agency may seize assets or garnish paychecks
            to satisfy the debt. In extreme cases, some people can end up with
            heavy fines or even jail time for non-payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filers who owe the IRS may opt to sell personal possessions, such as
            jewelry or sports equipment, to pay the tax bill. Others may opt to
            use a credit card to pay their taxes. Although not everyone has
            these options, the more money a person can put towards his or her
            tax bill, reducing the principal amount owed, the less interest will
            accumulate.

          <h2>Penalties for Nonpayment of Taxes Owed</h2>
          <p>
            According to the
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/penalties">IRS</a>, not paying
            taxes owed under the law leaves the filer subject to certain fines
            and interest charges based on the amount owed. These can accumulate
            over time. However, making a payment of any amount towards the
            outstanding tax bill demonstrates to the IRS that the individual is
            making a reasonable faith effort to pay the amount due. To help
            taxpayers avoid these penalties, the IRS offers options to make
            arrangements for paying outstanding tax bills.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IRS has the right to seize assets from your bank account or
            garnish paychecks from anyone who avoids paying their taxes. The
            government agency will use enforcement measures to collect the debt
            and may even put a lien on any property owned by the taxpayer. Often
            as a last resort, the IRS can also levy bank accounts, which means
            simply taking money out of the taxpayer’s account to cover the debt.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Payment Plan Options Offered by the IRS</h2>
          <p>
            If a taxpayer cannot make full payment after filing a tax return, he
            or she may contact the IRS to request a payment plan for their tax
            liability. The IRS website offers a portal for individuals or
            couples to set up payment arrangements, although they will still pay
            interest on the outstanding balance. According to the IRS, taxpayers
            are expected to file their returns by the due date and pay as much
            of the amount owed as possible. If there is still an outstanding
            balance, the IRS may allow taxpayers one of the following options:
          </p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 50px">
            <li><b>Installment Agreement</b>—paying a set amount each month</li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Offer in Compromise</b>—the taxpayer settles with the IRS for
              less than the initial amount owed
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Application for Extension</b>—if approved, the IRS extends the
              time a taxpayer is allowed to pay the tax debt due to hardship
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Installment Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            Taxpayers who ask the IRS to consider an installment payment plan
            should attach an
            <a
              href="https://www.irs.gov/site-index-search?search=Installment+Agreement+Request+Form+9465&field_pup_historical_1=1&field_pup_historical=1"
              >Installment Agreement Request Form 9465</a
            >
            to the top of the tax return. The IRS states that the approval
            process is streamlined for people who owe less than $25,000 and who
            can pay the debt off within five years. On the form, the taxpayer
            will propose a monthly amount to send to the IRS and a monthly
            payment due date. The installment arrangement fee is $43. Interest
            on the outstanding balance is 0.5 percent, but it drops to 0.25
            percent after the IRS approves the installment plan. The late filing
            penalty is 5 percent of the balance due for tax returns that were
            not filed on time. The IRS encourages taxpayers who owe to pay as
            much of the balance as they can when filing their tax returns to
            reduce the financial penalties.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Offer in Compromise</h2>
          <p>
            The other option that the IRS offers for people who cannot pay their
            tax liability is an Offer in Compromise. People who are in financial
            hardship and cannot afford a payment plan may ask the IRS to settle
            the debt for less than what is owed. To apply, the IRS requires the
            filer to sendForm 656, Offer in Compromise, and Fr 433A, Collection
            Information Statement. The forms allow the IRS to review the
            applicant’s finances to determine whether he or she is truly unable
            to pay the bill.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Application for Extension</h2>
          <p>
            The IRS offers another option for those experiencing undue hardship.
            Filers can apply for a payment extension usingForm 1127, Application
            for Extension of Time for Payment of Tax Due to Undue Hardship. This
            is considered a true hardship extension, and the IRS will ask for a
            statement of the applicant’s current assets and liabilities, as well
            as an itemized statement of all monies received and spent in the
            last three months. Payment extensions are rarely granted and
            typically not granted in cases where the individual did not
            anticipate owing taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            An experienced tax attorney at Damiens Law can help taxpayers
            understand their options with the IRS and represent clients in
            negotiations with the IRS.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Other Options for Settling Unexpected Tax Debt</h2>
          <p>
            Some filers may opt to use credit cards to pay their taxes. While
            this takes care of the obligation to the government, going into debt
            with a credit card company may not be the wisest financial option.
            The tax liability still needs to be paid, and the interest rate on
            nearly all credit cards is much more than the interest rate that the
            IRS charges on its payment plans. Another method to repay the IRS is
            to borrow the amount necessary through a personal loan or a debt
            consolidation loan from the bank. Again, while taking out a loan to
            pay you tax liability will discharge the tax debt, the interest
            rates on these types of loans will likely be higher than the
            interest rate of an IRS payment plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homeowners with equity may be eligible for a home equity line of
            credit, which has a lower interest rate than personal loans and
            credit cards. However, defaulting on the home equity loan may have
            the same impact as defaulting on a home mortgage—homeowners could
            lose their house. Filers with emergency funds may choose instead to
            use part of that money to pay the IRS. Borrowing money to pay the
            IRS may, however, be an option if the taxpayer’s payment plan is
            rejected or if the taxpayer does not qualify for an Offer in
            Compromise.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Budget for Interest, Late Fees, and Penalties</h2>
          <p>
            Any tax amount that is paid late to the IRS will have penalties and
            interest assessed. The more a taxpayer can pay towards the balance
            when filing, the lower the amount of interest will be for them to
            pay in the future. When budgeting for a proposed tax payment plan,
            include interest and late fees in the calculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taxpayers are encouraged to pay as much as they can when filing an
            annual return. They can then make payments using Form 1040-V until
            the IRS approves the installment plan or the Offer in Compromise.
            Taxpayers are expected to make payments toward their tax bills while
            waiting for the IRS to respond.

          <h2>A Tax Lawyer Can Help If You Cannot Pay Your Taxes</h2>
          <p>
            A tax lawyer or tax professional can help people better understand
            their options and their rights if they are struggling with the
            question, “What if you cannot pay your taxes?” A lawyer may be able
            to help a taxpayer avoid certain enforcement measures or jail time.
            While every situation is different, a tax professional who
            understands the tax laws, consequences of a federal tax lien and
            penalties can help people better protect themselves and their
            finances. Consider calling Damiens Law at (662) 442-4423 in
            Mississippi or (901) 499-4466 in Tennessee to schedule a
